    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to optimize for the application's focus on user-specific habit tracking and progress visualization. By structuring data under user-specific collections, we ensure data isolation and efficient querying. The structure prioritizes path-based ownership and avoids complex authorization logic, making security rules simpler and more robust.\n\n*   `/users/{userId}`: Stores user profiles.\n*   `/users/{userId}/habits/{habitId}`: Stores habits owned by a specific user.\n*   `/users/{userId}/habits/{habitId}/completions/{completionId}`: Stores completion records for each habit, nested under the habit document.\n\n**Authorization Independence (CRITICAL):**\n\nThis design inherently supports Authorization Independence. Because habits and their completion records are nested under the user's document, access control can be easily enforced based on the authenticated user ID (`request.auth.uid`). No `get()` calls are needed to verify ownership, as the path itself establishes the relationship.\n\n**QAPs (Rules are not Filters):**\n\nThe chosen structure facilitates secure `list` operations because all documents within a collection share the same security requirements. For example, listing habits under `/users/{userId}/habits` only requires verifying that `request.auth.uid == userId`. This structure avoids the need to filter based on document content, ensuring QAPs are met."
